# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Jack Micklis**

**Wordle** is an app that creates a word guessing game for users. The app chooses a random word, the user can choose the length between 4 and 7. The word can be totally random, an animal, or a country depending on settings input by the user. The app can increse in difficulty by turning on the setting "Alien Wordle" that will make the word change after every guess.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Notes

It was challenging at first when I had to safely unwrap the optional before I changed the Wordle board. I was confused with how to check the type of the input settings, but after looking at the guides I understood how to do it.
